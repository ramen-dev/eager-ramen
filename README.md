# Eager Wrapper for Ramen 

This is an example app for [Eager](https://eager.io).

This app inserts an embed code from ‘Ramen’ a completely real
SaaS provider.  To make the app your own, download this project to your computer, and open the folder
in the [App Tester](https://eager.io/developer/app-tester).  Then update the embed in app.js
to what your service needs.

For more information about Eager and developing
apps, please visit the [developer docs](https://eager.io/developer/docs).

As always, you can contact us at [developer-help@eager.io](mailto:developer-help@eager.io)
with any questions or concerns.
